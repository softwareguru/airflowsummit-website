I’m an expert in analytical data platforms and have worked with large-scale data warehouses, Big Data, ETL/ELT and streaming services for more than 20  years.  My focus has been working with Data Scientists to build scalable, robust and insightful solutions for e-retail, online payments, web analytics, event streaming for fraud detection and recommendation systems.  I’m certified on both AWS and GCP clouds and often advise on bridging On-prem and cloud solutions.
