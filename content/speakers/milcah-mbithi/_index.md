Milcah Mbithi is a data engineer from Kenya with vast experience designing scalable data pipelines using Apache Airflow. My passion for healthcare, especially in Kenya, stems from the limited access and quality, which often face significant challenges. My focus lies on applying automation to data workflows to improve decision-making and outcomes in healthcare settings. I am dedicated to driving innovation that enhances operational efficiency and helps address healthcare gaps in my community.
