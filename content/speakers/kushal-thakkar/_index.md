Kushal is a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area with experience building large-scale data platforms and tools. His career spans roles at Anthropic, where he supports AI research through data and observability platforms, and at Meta (Facebook), where he helped scale the company’s internal Spark platform and led initiatives to optimize batch data processing at scale.

Outside of work, he enjoys staying close to water—whether it’s swimming, kayaking, or just being by the coast.
