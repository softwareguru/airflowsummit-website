My career has focused on developing highly scalable and automated data processing systems.  I am currently focused on Data Civics and empowering the entire user community to play a role in the governance of data assets through efforts of data democratization.  By leveraging automation and integration of technology and process I am focused on creating modern data platforms that enable development of intuitive reports and dashboards that provide advanced analytic insights.
