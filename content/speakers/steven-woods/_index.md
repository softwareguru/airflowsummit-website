I've been a part of Zelis since 2011, contributing to our platform that connects payers, providers, and consumers within the healthcare ecosystem. As Director of Software Engineering on the Data and Innovation team, I lead the development of solutions and services. I've achieved proficiency in Airflow data orchestration since 2019, which complements my established expertise in web application development.
