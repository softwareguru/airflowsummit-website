I'm a Senior Data Integration Developer at Trendyol, specializing in data lake and data warehouse design, ETL processes, and scalable data solutions. With experience in GCP, BigQuery, Airflow, Kubernetes, and Docker, I focus on building efficient and automated data pipelines. Previously, I worked with AWS, Presto, and Spark on large-scale data projects. Passionate about data engineering, I love optimizing workflows and enabling data-driven decisions.
