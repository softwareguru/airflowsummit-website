With nearly 14 years of experience at Allegro, I currently serve as a Senior Data Engineer. My journey began in the Infrastructure and Services Maintenance Team. I have specialized in big data solutions, initially I was maintaining and expanding one of the largest Hadoop clusters in Europe and now I am focused on cloud data platforms.
I was involved in delivering Airflow-based solutions, and currently I am responsible for delivering Google Cloud Composer-based solutions in our organization.
