Working as a Senior Data Engineer at Allegro, I'm all about building and maintaining reliable data infrastructure and tools. Together with my awesome X-Wing team we do our best to  make working with data easily accessible for everyone at Allegro. I enjoy problem-solving and helping others to make working with data smooth and efficient. I am always on a lookout for learning from others at the same time trying to share knowledge whenever possible.
