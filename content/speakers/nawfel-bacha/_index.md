In a world driven by data, I strive to write the code that turns numbers into narratives.

Passionate about enhancing data through automation and AI. My expertise lies in data modeling and crafting efficient data pipelines to ensure data is always right where it needs to be. 

Having had the opportunity to be a speaker in the data community, I value the power of sharing knowledge and insights to foster growth and innovation.
