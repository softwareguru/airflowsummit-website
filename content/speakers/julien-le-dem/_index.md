Julien Le Dem is a Principal Engineer at Datadog, serves as an officer of the ASF and is a member of the LFAI&Data Technical Advisory Council. He co-created the Parquet, Arrow and OpenLineage open source projects and is involved in several others. His career leadership began in Data Platforms at Yahoo! - where he received his Hadoop initiation - then continued at Twitter, Dremio and WeWork. He then co-founded Datakin (acquired by Astronomer) to solve Data Observability. His French accent makes his talks particularly attractive.
