I'm a software engineer dedicated to enhancing data team efficiency. At OLX, I specialize in data platform advancement, focusing on data processing and governance. With a background in mathematics and computer science, I believe in the reality of what math describes, bringing it to life through machine languages. Outside of work, I love traveling, cheering for my favorite football team (Lech Poznań) and unraveling the mysteries of David Lynch's films.
