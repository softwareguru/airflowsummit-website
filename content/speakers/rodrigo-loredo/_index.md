With over 8 years of experience working with data, I've explored various roles. Currently, I work as a Lead Analytics Engineer at Vinted's Data Platform team, where we build and maintain tooling that supports over 200 data professionals in creating and orchestrating data products.
My linguistics background helps me connect technical precision with clear concepts and drive impactful solutions.
