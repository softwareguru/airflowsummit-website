Ash is a long time open-source contributor across many programming langauges and has been through the gamut of Developer, Sys Admin, "Dev Ops" and back around to Developer again, these days writing Python (and YAML!).

He has been on the Airflow PMC since 2018 (PPMC as it was then) and was instrumental in writing the HA support for the Scheduler. He is currently the Director of Airflow Engineering at Astronomer.io
