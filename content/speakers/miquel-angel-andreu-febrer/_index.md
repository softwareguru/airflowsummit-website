I'm a Staff Data Engineer with a passion for building efficient ETL pipelines and automating through DevOps practices. Currently, I'm a Staff Data Engineer at Okta in Madrid. My career has taken me through roles at Auth0 and HelloFresh in Berlin, where I specialized in developing and optimizing Spark data pipelines and empowering teams with self-service data tools. I also contributed to the Apache Software Foundation as an Apache Zeppelin Developer
