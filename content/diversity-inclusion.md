<h1 class="text-center">Celebrating 10 years of Airflow with D&I</h1>

<br>

We want to scale to the next data era with Airflow 3.0 in a diverse and inclusive environment. Regardless of geography, gender, sexual orientation, dis/ability, race, ethnicity, age, religion, economic status or any other characteristic. We believe that every difference, even the smallest ones, not only make everyone unique, but also enrich the community. Diversity gives us the opportunity to keep learning and growing as human beings.

We are proud to announce the diversity and inclusion setup in which we have been carefully working based on other models all over the world. We want this event to be comfortable and memorable for everyone. We want you to feel included, confident and free to share whatever is on your mind. These are some of the scopes that we are taking into consideration:

* Visa assistance

We assist people from all over the world with requested information such as providing the invitation letter required for visa processing.

* Venue Accessibility

The venue is equipped with accessible areas. If you need any assistance about onsite accessibility, please speak to the event staff at any of the registration or the information desks onsite.

* Pronouns stickers

In order to make you feel more comfortable, we will have “He” “She” & “They” stickers available that you can add to your badge so that you can indicate how you would like people to refer to you.

* Inclusive food menu

The lunch will have food alternatives for all tastes, including vegan and gluten free options. Make sure you contact us for any specific restrictions or allergies.

* T-shirts in different sizes

We will make sure that the shirts are of different sizes so that people feel comfortable wearing them. If you prefer another size let us know at the registration.

* First Aid/Medical Assistance

If you require first aid or medical assistance, please visit our registration desk, the venue front desk or call:. The choice to wear a protective facemask. “Everyone’s risk profile is different, and we don’t tolerate comments about the health choices other attendees make.”

* Inclusive spaces

There will be quiet rooms available. Please contact our registration desk for getting access if needed.

* Code of Conduct

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately.
