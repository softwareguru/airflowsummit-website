Airflow Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled, at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated in any talk or activity related to the event. Exhibitors should also refrain from using sexualized images, activities, or other material. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us at hello@airflowsummit.org
