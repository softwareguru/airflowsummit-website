Airflow Summit is the annual conference for the worldwide community of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) users and contributors. This conference is a celebration of the people who make Airflow what it is.

Apache Airflow thrives because of its vibrant, global community. From open-source contributors and maintainers to data engineers and companies using Airflow at scale, every member plays a crucial role in keeping the project evolving. Airflow Summit is the place where this community comes together to share knowledge, solve challenges, and drive innovation forward.

The 2025 edition will take place on October 7-9 at the Hyatt Regency in Seattle, USA, bringing together the brightest minds in workflow orchestration. Expect insightful talks, hands-on workshops, and plenty of opportunities to meet and collaborate with fellow Airflow enthusiasts. Whether you're contributing code, shaping best practices, or just starting your Airflow journey, this event is for you.
