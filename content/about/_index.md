Airflow Summit is the annual conference for the worldwide community of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) users and contributors. This conference is a celebration of the people who make Airflow what it is.

Apache Airflow thrives because of its vibrant, global community. From open-source contributors and maintainers to data engineers and companies using Airflow at scale, every member plays a crucial role in keeping the project evolving. Airflow Summit is the place where this community comes together to share knowledge, solve challenges, and drive innovation forward.

The 2025 edition will take place on October 7-9 at the Hyatt Regency in Seattle, USA, making it exceptional with the launch of Airflow 3.0, bringing together the brightest minds in workflow orchestration. Expect insightful talks, hands-on workshops, and plenty of opportunities to meet and collaborate with fellow Airflow enthusiasts. Whether you're contributing code, shaping best practices, or just starting your Airflow journey, this event is for you.

Learn from Past Events: Airflow Summit previous editions have a strong track record of success, and weâ€™re excited to build on that for 2025. If youâ€™re looking for sessions and recordings from previous years, you can find them [here](/sessions/).

Join us in Seattle to connect, learn, and be part of the future of Apache Airflow. Because great things happen when the community comes together! ðŸš€
