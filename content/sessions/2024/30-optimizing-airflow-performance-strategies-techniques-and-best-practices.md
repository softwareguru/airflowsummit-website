Airflow, an open-source platform for orchestrating complex data workflows, is widely adopted for its flexibility and scalability. However, as workflows grow in complexity and scale, optimizing Airflow performance becomes crucial for efficient execution and resource utilization. This session delves into the importance of optimizing Airflow performance and provides strategies, techniques, and best practices to enhance workflow execution speed, reduce resource consumption, and improve system efficiency. Attendees will gain insights into identifying performance bottlenecks, fine-tuning workflow configurations, leveraging advanced features, and implementing optimization strategies to maximize pipeline throughput. Whether you're a seasoned Airflow user or just getting started, this session equips you with the knowledge and tools needed to optimize your Airflow deployments for optimal performance and scalability. We'll also explore topics such as DAG writing best practices, monitoring and updating Airflow configurations, and database performance optimization, covering unused indexes, missing indexes, and minimizing table and index bloat.
