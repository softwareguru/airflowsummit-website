At the enterprise level, managing Airflow deployments across multiple teams can become complex, leading to bottlenecks and slowed development cycles. We will share our journey of decentralizing Airflow repositories to empower data engineering teams with multi-tenancy, clean folder structures, and streamlined DevOps processes.

We dive into how restructuring our Airflow architecture and utilizing repository templates allowed teams to generate new data pipelines effortlessly. This approach enables engineers to focus on business logic without worrying about underlying Airflow configurations. By automating deployments and reducing manual errors through CI/CD pipelines, we minimized operational overhead.

However, this transformation wasn't without challenges. We'll discuss obstacles we faced, such as maintaining code consistency, variables, and utility functions across decentralized repositories; ensuring compliance in a multi-tenant environment; and managing the learning curve associated with new workflows.

Join us to discover practical insights on how decentralizing Airflow repositories can boost team productivity and adapt to evolving business needs with minimal effort.
