In the age of Generative AI, knowledge bases are the backbone of intelligent systems, enabling them to deliver accurate and context-aware responses. But how do you ensure that these knowledge bases remain up-to-date and relevant in a rapidly changing world? Enter Apache Airflow, a robust orchestration tool that streamlines the automation of data workflows.

This talk will explore how Airflow can be leveraged to manage and update AI knowledge bases across multiple data sources. We'll dive into the architecture, demonstrate how Airflow enables efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), and share insights on tackling challenges like data consistency, scheduling, and scalability.

Whether you're building your own AI-driven systems or looking to optimize existing workflows, this session will provide practical takeaways to make the most of Apache Airflow in orchestrating intelligent solutions.
