Airflow has become default orchestration tool in our day to day business. Here I want to focus on the Data Mesh Architecture and how we can plug airflow orchestration to our major workflows.

Data Mesh has become default architecture for most of the large organisations to build data platform. And orchestration is a key enabler for this across data products, ingestion and transformation.

How they work together:

Airflow for Data Mesh Pipelines:
Airflow can be used to orchestrate data pipelines within a data mesh architecture, ensuring the smooth flow of data between different domains.

OpenMetadata and Data Mesh:
OpenMetadata can be used to provide visibility into the metadata of data products within a data mesh, helping to understand data structure, relationships, and context.

Benefits of using Airflow with Data Mesh:

Increased Agility:
Airflow allows for flexible data pipelines, enabling quick adaptation to changing business needs within a data mesh.

Enhanced Data Governance:
Data mesh promotes federated data governance, which, when combined with Airflow, helps ensure data quality and compliance across the organizations.
