This session presents a comprehensive guide to building applications that integrate with Apache Airflow's database migration system. We'll explore how to harness Airflow's robust Alembic-based migration toolchain to maintain schema compatibility between Airflow and custom applications, enabling developers to create solutions that evolve alongside the Airflow ecosystem without disruption.
