The weav.ai platform is built on top of Apache Airflow, chosen for its deterministic, predictable execution coupled with extreme developer customizability. weav.ai has seamlessly integrated its AI agents with Airflow to enable a unified AI orchestration to bring the power of scalability, robustness and the intelligence of AI in a single process. This talk will focus on the use cases being served, an architecture overview of the key Airflow capabilities being leveraged, and how Agentic AI has been seamlessly integrated to deliver the AI powered workflows. 
Weav.aiâ€™s platform is agnostic to any specific cloud or LLM and can orchestrate across those based on the use case.
