Airflow is a powerhouse for batch data pipelines—but can it be tuned for real-time workloads? In this session, we’ll share how we adapted Apache Airflow to orchestrate near-real-time data processing at scale. From leveraging event-driven triggers and external APIs to minimizing latency with smart DAG design, we’ll dive into real-world architectural patterns, challenges, and optimizations that helped us handle time-sensitive data workflows with confidence. This talk is ideal for teams seeking to expand beyond batch and explore hybrid or real-time orchestration using Airflow.
