This session will detail Allegro's, a leading e-commerce company in Poland, journey with Apache Airflow. It will chart our evolution from a custom, on-premises Airflow-as-a-Service solution through a significant expansion to over 300 Cloud Composer instances in Google Cloud, culminating in Airflow becoming the core of our data processing. We orchestrate over 64,000 regular tasks spanning over 6,000 active DAGs on more than 200 Airflow instances. From feeding business-supporting dashboards, to managing main data marts, and handling ML pipelines, and more.

We will share our practical experiences, lessons learned, and the strategies employed to manage and scale this critical infrastructure. Furthermore, we will introduce our innovative economy-of-share approach for providing ready-to-use Airflow environments, significantly enhancing both user productivity and cost efficiency.
