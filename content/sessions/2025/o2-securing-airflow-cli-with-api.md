This talk will explore the key changes introduced by AIP-81, focusing on security enhancements and user experience improvements across the entire software development lifecycle.

We will break down the technical advancements from both a security and usability perspective, addressing key questions for Apache Airflow users of all levels. Topics include and not limited to isolating CLI communication to enhance security via leveraging Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within the API for secure database interactions, clearly defining local vs. remote command execution and future improvements.
