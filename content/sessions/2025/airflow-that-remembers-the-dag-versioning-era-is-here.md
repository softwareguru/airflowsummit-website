Airflow 3 introduced a game-changing feature: Dag versioning.

Gone are the days of “latest only” Dags and confusing, inconsistent UI views when pipelines change mid-flight. This talk covers:
- Visualizing Dag changes over time in the UI
- How Dags code is versioned and can be grabbed from external sources
- Executing a whole Dag run against the same code version
- Dynamic Dags? Where do they fit in?!

You’ll see real-world scenarios, UI demos, and learn how these advancements will help avoid “Airflow amnesia”.
