Discover how Apache Airflow powers scalable ELT pipelines, enabling seamless data ingestion, transformation, and machine learning-driven insights. This session will walk through:

Automating Data Ingestion: Using Airflow to orchestrate raw data ingestion from third-party sources into your data lake (S3, GCP), ensuring a steady pipeline of high-quality training and prediction data.

Optimizing Transformations with Serverless Computing: Offloading intensive transformations to serverless functions (GCP Cloud Run, AWS Lambda) and machine learning models (BigQuery ML, Sagemaker), integrating their outputs seamlessly into Airflow workflows.

Real-World Impact: A case study on how INTRVL leveraged Airflow, BigQuery ML, and Cloud Run to analyze early voting data in near real-time, generating actionable insights on voter behavior across swing states.

This talk not only provides a deep dive into the Political Tech space but also serves as a reference architecture for building robust, repeatable ELT pipelines. Attendees will gain insights into modern serverless technologies from AWS and GCP that enhance Airflowâ€™s capabilities, helping data engineers design scalable, cloud-agnostic workflows.
