As Data Engineers, our jobs regularly include scheduling or scaling workflows.

But have you ever asked yourself, can I scale my scheduling ?

It turns out that you can!
But doing so raises a number of issues that need to be addressed.

In this talk we'll be:
- Recapping Asset-aware scheduling in Apache Airflow
- Discussing diverse methods to upscale our scheduling
- Solving the issue of maintaining our Airflow Asset synchronized between instances
- Comparing our professional push based solution and the built-in solution from [AIP-82](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-82+External+event+driven+scheduling+in+Airflow) and the pros and cons of each method.

I hope you will enjoy it!
