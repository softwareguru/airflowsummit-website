Are you looking to build slick, dynamic trigger forms for your DAGs? It all starts with mastering params.

Params are the gold standard for adding execution options to your DAGs, allowing you to create dynamic, user-friendly trigger forms with descriptions, validation, and now, with Airflow 3, bidirectional support for conf data!

In this talk, we'll break down how to use params effectively, share best practices, and explore what's new since the 2023 Airflow Summit talk (https://airflowsummit.org/sessions/2023/flexible-dag-trigger-forms-aip-50/). If you want to make DAG execution more flexible, intuitive, and powerful, this session is a must-attend!
