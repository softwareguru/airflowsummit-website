As Apache Airflow adoption accelerates for data pipeline orchestration, integrating it effectively into your enterprise's Automation Center of Excellence (CoE) is crucial for maximizing ROI, ensuring governance, and standardizing best practices. This session explores common challenges faced when bringing specialized tools like Airflow into a broader CoE framework. We'll demonstrate how leveraging enterprise automation platforms like Automic Automation can simplify this integration by providing centralized orchestration, standardized lifecycle management, and unified auditing for Airflow DAGs alongside other enterprise workloads. Furthermore, discover how Automation Analytics & Intelligence (AAI) can offer the CoE a single pane of glass for monitoring performance, tracking SLAs, and proving the business value of Airflow initiatives within the complete automation landscape. Learn practical strategies to ensure Airflow becomes a well-governed, high-performing component of your overall automation strategy.
