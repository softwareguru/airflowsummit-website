At TrueCar, migrating hundreds of legacy Oozie workflows and in-house orchestration tools to Apache Airflow required key technical decisions that transformed our data platform architecture and organizational capabilities.
We consolidated individual chained tasks into optimized DAGs leveraging native Airflow functionality to trigger compute across cloud environments. A crucial breakthrough was developing DAG generators to scale migration—essential for efficiently migrating hundreds of workflows while maintaining consistency.
By decoupling orchestration from compute, we gained flexibility to select optimal tools for specific outcomes—programmatic processing, analytics, batch jobs, or AI/ML pipelines. This resulted in cost reductions, performance improvements, and team agility. We also gained unprecedented visibility into DAG performance and dependency patterns previously invisible across fragmented systems.
Attendees will learn how we redesigned complex workflows into efficient DAGs using dynamic task generation, architectural decisions that enabled platform innovation and the decision framework that made our migration transformational.
