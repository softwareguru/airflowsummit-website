This talk explores EDB's journey from siloed reporting to a unified data platform, powered by Airflow. We'll delve into the architectural evolution, showcasing how Airflow orchestrates a diverse range of use cases, from Analytics Engineering to complex MLOps pipelines.

Learn how EDB leverages Airflow and Cosmos to integrate dbt for robust data transformations, ensuring data quality and consistency.

We'll provide a detailed case study of our MLOps implementation, demonstrating how Airflow manages training, inference, and model monitoring pipelines for Azure Machine Learning models.

Discover the design considerations driven by our internal data governance framework and gain insights into our future plans for AIOps integration with Airflow.
