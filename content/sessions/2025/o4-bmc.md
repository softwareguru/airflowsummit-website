Airflow powers thousands of data and ML pipelines—but in the enterprise, these pipelines often need to interact with business-critical systems like ERPs, CRMs, and core banking platforms.

In this demo-driven session we will connect Airflow with Control-M from BMC and showcase how Airflow can participate in end-to-end workflows that span not just data platforms but also transactional business applications.

Session highlights

 * Trigger Airflow DAGs based on business events (e.g., invoice approvals, trade settlements)
 * Feed Airflow pipeline outputs into ERP systems (e.g., SAP) or CRMs (e.g., Salesforce)
 * Orchestrate multi-platform workflows from cloud to mainframe with SLA enforcement, dependency management, and centralized control.
 * Provide unified monitoring and auditing across data and application layers
