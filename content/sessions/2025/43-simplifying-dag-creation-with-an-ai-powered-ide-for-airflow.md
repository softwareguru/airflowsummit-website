As the demand for data products grows, data engineering teams face mounting pressure to deliver more and even faster, often becoming bottlenecks. Astro IDE changes the game.

Astro IDE is an AI-powered code editor built for Apache Airflow. It helps data teams go from idea to production in minutesâ€”generating production-ready DAGs, enabling in-browser testing, and integrating directly with Git.

In this session, see how Astro IDE accelerates DAG creation, debugging, and deployment so data engineering teams can deliver more, 10x faster.
