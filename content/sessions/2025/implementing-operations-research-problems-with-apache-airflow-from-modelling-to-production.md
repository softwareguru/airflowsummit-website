This workshop will provide an overview of implementing operations research problems using Apache Airflow. This is a hands-on session where attendees will gain experience creating DAGs to define and manage workflows for classical operations research problems. The workshop will include several examples of how Airflow can be used to optimize and automate various decision-making processes, including:

Inventory management: How to use Airflow to optimize inventory levels and reduce stockouts by analyzing demand patterns, lead times, and other factors.

Production planning: How to use Airflow to create optimized production schedules that minimize downtime, reduce costs, and increase throughput.

Logistics optimization: How to use Airflow to optimize transportation routes and other factors to improve the efficiency of logistics operations.

Attendees will come away with a solid understanding of using Airflow to automate decision-making processes with optimization solvers.
