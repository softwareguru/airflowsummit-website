Small retailers often lack the data visibility that larger companies rely on for decision-making. In this session, weâ€™ll dive into how Apache Airflow powers end-to-end machine learning pipelines that process inventory and sales data, enabling retailers and suppliers to gain valuable industry insights. We'll cover feature engineering, model training, and automated inference workflows, along with strategies for handling messy, incomplete retail data. We will discuss how Airflow enables scalable ML-driven insights that improve demand forecasting, product categorization, and supply chain optimization.
