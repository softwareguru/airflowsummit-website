What happens when you introduce Apache Airflow in an environment where every change must pass compliance gates, infrastructure is tightly controlled, and public cloud is off-limits?

This talk shares the journey of implementing Airflow within a high-security, regulation-heavy setting, navigating legacy systems, manual workflows, and cautious stakeholders.

What You’ll Learn:

1. How Airflow was deployed on-premise without Docker or cloud dependencies
2. How GitHub Actions were used to bridge Windows-based engineers with a Linux-hosted Airflow instance
3. How we worked through security reviews and compliance requirements to gain production approval
4. What worked, what didn’t, and lessons for teams facing similar constraints

Who Should Attend:

- Engineers in finance, healthcare, or public sector environments
- Teams trying to modernize workflows under tight security or legacy policies

This isn’t just a technical session, it’s a case study in navigating resistance and building automation under real-world constraints.
