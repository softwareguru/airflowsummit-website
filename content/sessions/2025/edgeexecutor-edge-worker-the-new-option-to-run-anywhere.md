Airflow 3 extends the deployment options to run your workload anywhere. You don't need to bring your data to airflow but you can bring the execution where it needs to be.

You can connect any cloud and on-prem location together and generate a hybrid workflow from one central Airflow instance. Only a HTTP connection is needed.

We will present the use cases and concepts of the Edge deployment and how it is working also in a hybrid setup with Celery or other executors.

Note: This session is registered as short talk but can be merged to a long session by merging with other talk "Edge Worker - 12 months running anywhere in production"
