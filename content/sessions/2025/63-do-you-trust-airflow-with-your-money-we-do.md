Airflow is wonderfully, frustratingly complex - and so is global finance! Stripe has very specific needs all over the planet, and we have customized Airflow to adapt to the variety and rigor that we need to grow the GDP of the internet.


In this talk, you’ll learn:

- How we support independent DAG change management for over 500 different teams running over 150k tasks.

- How we’ve customized Airflow’s Kubernetes integration to comply with Stripe’s unique compliance requirements.

- How we’ve built on Airflow to support no-code data pipelines.
