Join us to explore the DAG Upgrade Agent. Developed with Google Agent Development Kit and powered by Gemini, the DAG Upgrade Agent uses a rules-based framework to analyze DAG code, identify compatibility issues between core airflow and provider package versions, and generates precise upgrade recommendations and automated code conversions. Perfect for upcoming Airflow 3.0 migrations.
