Red Hat's unified data and AI platform relies on Apache Airflow for orchestration, alongside Snowflake, Fivetran, and Atlan. The platform prioritizes building a dependable data foundation, recognizing that effective AI depends on quality data. Airflow was selected for its predictability, extensive connectivity, reliability, and scalability.

The platform now supports business analytics, transitioning from ETL to ELT processes. This has resulted in a remarkable improvement in how we make data available for business decisions.


The platform's capabilities are being extended to power Digital Workers (AI agents) using large language models, encompassing model training, fine-tuning, and inference. Two Digital Workers are currently deployed, with more in development.

This presentation will detail the rationale and background of this evolution, followed by an explanation of the architectural decisions made and the challenges encountered and resolved throughout the process of transforming into an AI-enabled data platform to power Red Hat’s business.
