This session will dive deep into leveraging the robust logging and audit capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, Cloud Composer and Apache Airflow to establish a fully transparent and verifiable data orchestration layer.

We'll demonstrate how to track and attribute every change—from environment configuration to individual task execution—essential for meeting stringent enterprise governance, compliance, and auditing requirements.
