In today's data-driven world, effective workflow management and AI are crucial for success. However, there's a notable gap between Airflow and AI. Our presentation offers a solution to close this gap.

Proposing MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to act as a bridge. We'll dive into two paths: 

- AI-Augmented Airflow: Enhancing Airflow with AI to improve error handling, automate DAG generation, proactively detect issues, and optimize resource use.
- Airflow-Powered AI: Utilizing Airflow's reliability to empower LLMs in executing complex tasks, orchestrating AI agents, and supporting decision-making with real-time data.

Key takeaways:
- Understanding how to integrate AI insights directly into your workflow orchestration.
- Learning how MCP empowers AI with robust orchestration capabilities, offering full logging, monitoring, and auditability. 
- Gaining insights into how to transform LLMS from a reactive responder to a proactive, intelligent, and reliable executor.

Inviting you to explore how MCP can help workflow management, making AI-driven decisions more reliable and turning workflow systems into intelligent, autonomous agents.
