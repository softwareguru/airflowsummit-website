In this keynote, Peeyush Rai and Vikram Koka will be walking through how Airflow is being used as part of a Agentic AI platform servicing insurance companies, which runs on all the major public clouds, leveraging models from Open AI, Google (Gemini), AWS (Claude and Bedrock). 

This talk walks through the details of the actual end user business workflow including gathering relevant financial data to make a decision, as well as the tricky challenge of handling AI hallucinations, with new Airflow capabilities such as “Human in the loop”. 

This talk offers something for both business and technical audiences. Business users will get a clear view of what it takes to bring an AI application into production and how to align their operations and business teams with an AI enabled workflow. Meanwhile, technical users will walk away with practical insights on how to orchestrate complex business processes enabling a seamless collaboration between Airflow, AI Agents and Human in the loop.
