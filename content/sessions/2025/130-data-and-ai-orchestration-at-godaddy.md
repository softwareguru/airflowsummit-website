As the adoption of Airflow increases within large enterprises to orchestrate their data pipelines, more than one team needs to create, manage, and run their workflows in isolation. With multi-tenancy not yet supported natively in Airflow, customers are adopting alternate ways to enable multiple teams to share infrastructure. In this session, we will explore how GoDaddy uses MWAA to build a Single Pane Airflow setup for multiple teams with a common observability platform, and how this foundation enables orchestration expansion beyond data workflows to AI workflows as well. We'll discuss our roadmap for leveraging upcoming Airflow 3 features, including the task execution API for enhanced workflow management and DAG versioning capabilities for comprehensive auditing and governance. This session will help attendees gain insights into the use case, the solution architecture, implementation challenges and benefits, and our strategic vision for unified orchestration across data and AI workloads.
