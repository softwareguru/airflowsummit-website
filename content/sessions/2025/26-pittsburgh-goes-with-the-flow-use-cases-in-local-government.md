The City of Pittsburgh utilizes Airflow (via Astronomer) for a wide variety of tasks. From employee-focused use cases, like time bank balancing and internal dashboards, to public-facing publication, the City's data flows through our DAGs from many sources to many sources. Airflow acts as a funnel point and is an essential tool for Pittsburgh's Data Services team.
