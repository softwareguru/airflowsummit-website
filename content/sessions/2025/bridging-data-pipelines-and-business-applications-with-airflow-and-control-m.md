AI and ML pipelines built in Airflow often power critical business outcomes, but they rarely operate in isolation. In this hands-on workshop, learn how Control-M integrates with Airflow to orchestrate end-to-end workflows that include upstream and downstream enterprise systems like Supply Chain and Billing. Gain visibility, reliability, and seamless coordination across your data pipelines and the business operations they support.
