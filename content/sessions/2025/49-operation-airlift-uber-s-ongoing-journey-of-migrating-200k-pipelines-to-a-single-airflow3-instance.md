Yes, you read that right — 200,000 pipelines, nearly 1 million task executions per day, all powered by a single Airflow instance.

In this session, we’ll take you behind the scenes of one of the boldest orchestration projects ever attempted: how Uber’s data platform team is executing what might be the largest Apache Airflow migration in history — and doing it straight to Airflow 3.

From scaling challenges and architectural choices to lessons learned in high-throughput orchestration, this is a deep dive into the tech, the chaos, and the strategy behind making data fly at unprecedented scale.
