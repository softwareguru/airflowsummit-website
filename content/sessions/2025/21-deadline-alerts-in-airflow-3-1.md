Do you have a DAG that needs to be done by a certain time? Have you tried to use Airflow 2's SLA feature and found it restrictive or complicated? You aren't alone!  Come learn about the all-new Deadline Alerts feature in Airflow 3.1 which replaces SLA. We will discuss how Deadline Alerts work and how they improve on the retired SLA feature. Then we will look at some examples of workflows you can build with the new feature, including some of the callback options and how they work, and finally looking ahead to some future use-cases of using Deadlines for Tasks and even Assets.
