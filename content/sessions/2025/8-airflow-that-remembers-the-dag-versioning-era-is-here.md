summary: "DAG versioning is one of the most important features introduced in Airflow 3. In this talk we will cover how DAG code is versioned, how to visualize changes over time in the UI, choosing versions to run a DAG and how to handle dynamic DAGs."

Airflow 3 introduced a game-changing feature: Dag versioning.

Gone are the days of “latest only” Dags and confusing, inconsistent UI views when pipelines change mid-flight. This talk covers:
- Visualizing Dag changes over time in the UI
- How Dags code is versioned and can be grabbed from external sources
- Executing a whole Dag run against the same code version
- Dynamic Dags? Where do they fit in?!

You’ll see real-world scenarios, UI demos, and learn how these advancements will help avoid “Airflow amnesia”.
