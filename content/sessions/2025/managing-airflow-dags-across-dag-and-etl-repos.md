At Lyft, we manage Airflow DAGs across both the ETL and DAG repos, each serving distinct needs. The ETL repo is ideal for simple use cases and users with only a few DAGs, offering a streamlined workflow. Meanwhile, the DAG repo supports power users with numerous DAGs, custom dependencies, and complex ML pipelines. In this session, Iâ€™ll share how we structure these repos, the trade-offs involved, and best practices for scaling Airflow DAG management across diverse teams and workloads.
