In this talk, Iâ€™ll walk through how we built an end-to-end analytics pipeline using open-source tools ( Airbyte, dbt, Airflow, and Metabase). At WirePick, we extract data from multiple sources using Airbyte OSS into PostgreSQL, transform it into business-specific data marts with dbt, and automate the entire workflow using Airflow. Our Metabase dashboards provide real-time insights, and we integrate Slack notifications to alert stakeholders when key business metrics change.

This session will cover:
- Data extraction: Using Airbyte OSS to pull data from multiple sources
- Transformation & Modeling: How dbt helps create reusable data marts
- Automation & Orchestration: Managing the workflow with Airflow
- Data-driven decision-making: Delivering insights through Metabase & Slack alerts
