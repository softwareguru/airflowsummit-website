As data workloads grow in complexity, teams need seamless orchestration to manage pipelines across batch, streaming, and AI/ML workflows. Apache Airflow provides a flexible and open-source way to orchestrate Databricks' entire platform, from SQL analytics with Materialized Views (MVs) and Streaming Tables (STs) to AI/ML model training and deployment.

In this session, we'll showcase how Airflow can automate and optimize Databricks workflows, reducing costs and improving performance for large-scale data processing. We'll highlight how MVs and STs eliminate manual incremental logic, enable real-time ingestion, and enhance query performanceâ€”all while maintaining governance and flexibility. Additionally, we'll demonstrate how Airflow simplifies ML model lifecycle management by integrating Databricks' AI/ML capabilities into end-to-end data pipelines.

Whether you're a dbt user seeking better performance, a data engineer managing streaming pipelines, or an ML practitioner scaling AI workloads, this session will provide actionable insights on using Airflow and Databricks together to build efficient, cost-effective, and future-proof data platforms.
