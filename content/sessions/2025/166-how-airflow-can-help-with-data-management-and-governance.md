Metadata management is a cornerstone of effective data governance, yet it presents unique challenges distinct from traditional data engineering. At scale, efficiently extracting metadata from relational and NoSQL databases demands specialized solutions. To address this, our team has developed custom Airflow operators that scan and extract metadata across various database technologies, orchestrating 100+ production jobs to ensure continuous and reliable metadata collection.

Now, we're expanding beyond databases to tackle non-traditional data sources such as file repositories and message queues. This shift introduces new complexities, including processing structured and unstructured files, managing schema evolution in streaming data, and maintaining metadata consistency across heterogeneous sources. In this session, weâ€™ll share our approach to building scalable metadata scanners, optimizing performance, and ensuring adaptability across diverse data environments. Attendees will gain insights into designing efficient metadata pipelines, overcoming common pitfalls, and leveraging Airflow to drive metadata governance at scale.
