In large organizations, multiple Apache Airflow instances often arise organicallyâ€”driven by team-specific needs, distinct use cases, or tiered workloads. This fragmentation introduces complexity, operational overhead, and higher infrastructure costs. To address these challenges, we developed the "Orchestration Frederator," a solution designed to unify and horizontally scale multiple Airflow deployments seamlessly.

This session will detail our journey in implementing Orchestration Frederator, highlighting how we achieved:
-- Horizontal Scalability: Seamlessly scaling Airflow across multiple instances without operational overhead
-- End-to-End Data Lineage: Constructing comprehensive data lineage across disparate Airflow deployments to simplify monitoring and debugging
-- Multi-Region Support: Introducing multi-region capabilities, enhancing reliability and disaster recovery
-- Unified Ecosystem: Consolidating previously fragmented Airflow environments into a cohesive orchestration platform

Join us to explore practical strategies, technical challenges, lessons learned, and best practices for enhancing scalability, reliability, and maintainability in large-scale Airflow deployments
