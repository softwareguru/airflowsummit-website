Forecasting the weather and air quality is a logistical challenge. Numerical simulations are complex, resource-hungry, and sometimes fail without warning. Yet, our clients depend on accurate forecasts delivered daily and on time. At the heart of this operation is Airflow: the orchestration engine that keeps everything running.

In this session, weâ€™ll dive into the world behind weather and air quality forecasts. In particular, we'll explore:

- The atmospheric modeling pipeline, to understand the unique demands it places on infrastructure
- How we use Airflow to orchestrate complex simulations reliably and at scale, to inspire new ways of managing time-critical, compute-heavy workflows.
- Our integration of Airflow with a high-performance computing (HPC) environment using Slurm, to run resource-intensive workloads efficiently in bare metal machines.

At Meteosim we are experts on weather and air quality intelligence. With projects in over 80 countries, we support decision-making in industries where weather and air quality matter most: from daily operations to long-term sustainability.
