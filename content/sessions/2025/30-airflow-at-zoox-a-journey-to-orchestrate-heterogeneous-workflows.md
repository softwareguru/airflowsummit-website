The workflow orchestration team at Zoox aims to build a solution for orchestrating heterogeneous workflows encompassing data, ML, and QA pipelines. We have encountered two primary challenges: first, the steep learning curve for new Airflow users and the need for a user-friendly yet scalable development process; second, integrating and migrating existing pipelines with established solutions.

This presentation will detail our approach, as a small team at Zoox, to address these challenges. The discussion will first present an exciting introduction to Zoox and what we do. Then we will walk down the memory lane of the past and current of Airflow use at Zoox. Furthermore, we will share our strategies for simplifying the Airflow DAG creation process and enhancing user experience. Lastly, we will share a few of our thoughts for how to grow the team and grow Airflow's presence at Zoox in the future.
