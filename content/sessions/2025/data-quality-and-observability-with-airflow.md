Tekmetric is the largest cloud based auto shop management system in the United States. We process vast amounts of data from various integrations with internal and external systems. Data quality and governance are crucial for both our internal operations and the success of our customers.

We leverage multi-step data processing pipelines using AWS services and Airflow. While we utilize traditional data pipeline workflows to manage and move data, we go beyond standard orchestration. After data is processed, we apply tailored quality checks for schema validation, record completeness, freshness,  duplication and more.

In this talk, we’ll explore how Airflow allows us to enhance data observability. We’ll discuss how Airflow’s flexibility enables seamless integration and monitoring across different teams and datasets, ensuring reliable and accurate data at every stage.

This session will highlight how Tekmetric uses data quality governance and observability practices to drive business success through trusted data.
