Airflow 3.0 is the most significant release in the project’s history, and brings a better user experience, stronger security, and the ability to run tasks anywhere, at any time. In this workshop, you’ll get hands-on experience with the new release and learn how to leverage new features like DAG versioning, backfills, data assets, and a new react-based UI. 

Whether you’re writing traditional ELT/ETL pipelines or complex ML and GenAI workflows, you’ll learn how Airflow 3 will make your day-to-day work smoother and your pipelines even more flexible. This workshop is suitable for intermediate to advanced Airflow users. Beginning users should consider taking the Airflow fundamentals course on the Astronomer Academy before attending this workshop.
