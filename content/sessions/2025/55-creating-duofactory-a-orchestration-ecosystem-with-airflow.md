Duolingo has built an internal tool DuoFactory to orchestrate AI generated content using Airflow. The tool has been used to generate example sentences per lesson, math exercises, and Duoradio lessons. The ecosystem is flexible for various company needs. Some of these use cases contain end to end generation where one click of a button generates content in app. We also have created a Workflow Builder to orchestrate and iterate on generative AI workflows by creating one-time DAG instances with a UI easy enough for non-engineers to use.
