OpenLineage has simplified collecting lineage metadata across the data ecosystem by standardizing its representation in an extensible model. It enabled a whole ecosystem improving data pipeline reliability and ease of troubleshooting in production environments. 
In this talk, we'll briefly introduce the OpenLineage model and explore how this metadata is collected from Airflow, Spark, dbt, and Flink. We'll demonstrate how to extract valuable insights and outline practical benefits and common challenges when building ingestion, processing and storage for OpenLineage data. We will also briefly show how OpenLineage events can be used to observe data pipelines exhastively and the benefits that brings.
