Our development workflows look dramatically different than they did a year ago. Code generation, automated testing, and AI-assisted documentation tools are now part of many developers' daily work.
Yet as these tools reshape how we code, I've noticed something worth examining: while our toolbox is changing rapidly, the core of being a good developer hasn't. Problem-solving, collaborative debugging, and systems thinking remain as crucial as ever.

In this keynote, I'll share observations about:

* Which parts of our workflow are genuinely enhanced by new tools
* The development skills that continue to separate good code from great code
* How teams can collaborate effectively when everyone's tools are evolving
* What Airflow's journey teaches us about balancing innovation with stability

No hype or grand pronouncementsâ€”just an honest look at incorporating new tools while preserving the craft that makes us developers in the first place.
