This session details practical strategies for introducing Apache Airflow in strict, compliance-heavy organizations. Learn how on-premise deployment and hybrid tooling can help modernize legacy workflows when public cloud solutions and container technologies are restricted. Discover how cross-platform engineering teams can collaborate securely using CI/CD bridges, and what it takes to meet rigorous security and governance standards. Key lessons address navigating resistance to change, achieving production sign-off, and avoiding common compliance pitfalls, relevant to anyone automating in public sector settings.
