Airflow 3 brings several exciting new features that better support MLOps:

* Native, intuitive backfills
* Removal of the unique execution date for dag runs
* Native support for event-driven scheduling

These features, combined with the Airflow AI SDK, enable dag authors to easily build scalable, maintainable, and performant LLMOps pipelines.

In this talk, we'll go through a series of workflows that use the Airflow AI SDK to empower Astronomer's support staff to more quickly resolve problems faced by Astronomer's customers.
