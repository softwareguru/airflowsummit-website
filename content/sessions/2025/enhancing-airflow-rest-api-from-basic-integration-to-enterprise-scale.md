Apache Airflow's REST API has evolved to support diverse orchestration needs, with managed services like MWAA introducing custom enhancements. One such feature, InvokeRestApi, enables dynamic interactions with external services while maintaining Airflow's core orchestration capabilities.

In this talk, we will explore the architectural design behind InvokeRestApi, detailing how it enhances API-driven workflows. Beyond the architecture, we'll share key challenges and learnings from implementing and scaling Airflow's REST API in production environments. Topics include authentication, performance considerations, error handling, and best practices for integrating external APIs efficiently.

Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of Airflow's API extensibility, its implications for workflow automation, and actionable insights for building robust, API-driven orchestration solutions. Whether you're an Airflow user or an architect, this session will provide valuable takeaways for simplifying API interactions across airflow environments.
