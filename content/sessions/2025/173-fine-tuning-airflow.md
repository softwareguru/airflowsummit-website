The Bloomberg Data Platform Engineering team is responsible for managing, storing, and providing access to business and financial data used by financial professionals across the global capital markets. Our team utilizes Apache Airflow to orchestrate data workflows across various applications and Bloomberg Terminal functions. Over the years, we have fine-tuned our Airflow cluster to handle more than 1,000 ingestion DAGs, which has presented unique scalability challenges. In this session, we will share insights into several key Airflow parameters — some of which you may not be all that familiar with — that our team uses to optimize and scale the platform effectively.
