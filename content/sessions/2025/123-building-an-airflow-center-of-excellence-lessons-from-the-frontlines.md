As organizations scale their data infrastructure, Apache Airflow becomes a mission-critical component for orchestrating workflows efficiently. But scaling Airflow successfully isnâ€™t just about running pipelinesâ€”itâ€™s about building a Center of Excellence (CoE) that empowers teams with the right strategy, best practices, and long-term enablement.
Join Jon Leek and Michelle Winters as they share their experiences helping customers design and implement Airflow Centers of Excellence. Theyâ€™ll walk through real-world challenges, best practices, and the structured approach Astronomer takes to ensure teams have the right plan, resources, and support to succeed.
Whether youâ€™re just starting with Airflow or looking to optimize and scale your workflows, this session will give you a proven framework to build a sustainable Airflow Center of Excellence within your organization. ðŸš€
