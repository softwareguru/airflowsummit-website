Transform your data pipelines with event-driven scheduling in Airflow 3. In this hands-on workshop, you’ll:

* Set up AssetWatchers to track S3, Kafka, or database events
* Build DAGs that trigger instantly on new data
* Master scaling techniques for high-volume workflows

Create a live pipeline—process logs or IoT data in real time—and adapt it to your needs. No event-driven experience required; just bring a laptop and Airflow basics. Gain practical skills to make your pipelines responsive and efficient.
