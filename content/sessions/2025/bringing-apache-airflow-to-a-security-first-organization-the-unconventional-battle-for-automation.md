What happens when you introduce Apache Airflow in an organization where every change is scrutinized, every deployment must pass security hurdles, and cloud is not an option?

In this talk, I share how I successfully implemented Airflow inside a high-compliance, security-driven environment, overcoming infrastructure limitations, manual workflows, and initial resistance from leadership.

This session will cover:
1. How I deployed Airflow in an on-premise, cost-conscious setup without Docker or cloud
2. How I automated DAG deployments from GitHub Actions, bridging Windows-based engineers with a Linux-hosted Airflow instance
3. Security and compliance challenges: Getting Airflow approved in a highly regulated setting
Scaling workflows: From a single team to cross-departmental adoption
4. What worked, what failed, and what I’d do differently

Who Should Attend?
1. Engineers working in finance, healthcare, or security-restricted industries
2. Teams trying to introduce Airflow but facing organizational resistance

This isn’t just a technical talk, it’s a real-world battle story about deploying Airflow where most wouldn’t even try.
