Have you faced a scenario where 100 worker slots are available to run the Tasks, but you have 100 DAGs waiting on a Sensor that’s currently running but idle, waiting for something to happen? Ultimately, you got frustrated as you could not run anything else - even though your entire Airflow cluster was essentially idle. This is exactly where the concept of Deferrable Operators is very useful. 
 
 
 
 This talk aims to give a brief introduction to solving this problem using Deferrable or Async Operators and how to implement it for your use case.
 
 
 
 This talk also aims to explain:
 
 - Introduction to deferrable operator
 
 - Introduction to Triggers
 
 - Using deferrable operator - real-world use case
 
 - Writing deferrable operators
 
  - Triggering deferral
 
  - Writing Triggers
 
 - Example of deferrable S3 Operator
 
 - Advantages over Smart Sensors and reschedule mode for sensor
 
 - Guide to implement your deferrable operator with astronomer-providers repository as an example to start with
