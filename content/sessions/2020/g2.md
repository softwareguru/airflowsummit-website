Learn how Devoted Health went from cron jobs to Airflow deployment Kubernetes using a combination of open source and internal tooling.
<!--more-->

Devoted Health, a Medicare Advantage startup, went from cron jobs to Airflow on Kubernetes in a short period of time. This journey is a common one, but still has a steep learning curve for new Airflow users. This talk will give you a blueprint to follow by covering the tools we use, best practices, and lessons learned. We'll share Devoted's approach to managing our deployment, monitoring the platform, and developing, testing, and deploying DAGs. This includes internal tooling we've written that allows Data Scientists to work with Airflow without worrying about Airflow itself.
