In this talk I will introduce a DAG authoring and editing tool for Airflow that we have built. Installed as a plugin, this tool allows users to author DAGs compose existing operators and hooks with virtually no Python experience. We walk through a demo of DAG authorship and deployment, and spend time reviewing the underlying open-source standards used and the general approach that was taken to develop the code.

In addition to allowing dags to be created in a visual editor, the underlying tech enables Airflow DAGs to be described programmatically in YAML or JSON. DAGs described there can be saved in backing databases instead of Python files.
