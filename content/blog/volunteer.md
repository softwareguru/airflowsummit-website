This year, we are accepting only Seattle-based volunteers. You will receive a complimentary event pass and a participant kit in exchange for your support during the event.

How you will help

Volunteer tasks will vary based on availability, the number of attendees, and your skills and interests. However, here are some general activities you may be assigned to:

Event Setup: Assist with setting up materials before the event starts each day.
Registration Support: Help at the registration table by distributing badges and participant kits to attendees.
Session Assistance: Introduce speakers, count attendees, facilitate Q&A sessions by running the microphone, display time cards during talks, and assist with other tasks as assigned by the track leads.
Technical Support: Help speakers with any technical issues they may encounter during their sessions or provide tech support for session recordings.
How to Apply

If you’d like to become a volunteer, please fill out this survey. While not all questions are mandatory, providing more details will help us evaluate your application more effectively.

Selections will be based on a combination of need and impact. Applications are not transferable to another person or event. The organizing committee will carefully review each application.

There are no wrong answers—our goal is to create a more inclusive and diverse event.

All information provided in the form will be used solely for application evaluation. After the event, all application data will be deleted.
