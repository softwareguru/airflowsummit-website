## Call for presentations for Airflow Summit 2025

Are you interested in speaking at Airflow Summit 2025? Check out the following information:

* Event date: October 7-9, 2025
* Format: In-person
* Location: Seattle, Washington (Hyatt Regency)
* CFP deadline: April 25 (round 1) & May 31 (round 2)
* CFP rounds & dates

### Rounds and dates
We will organize the CFP in 2 different rounds:

1. Round 1: From January 29 to April 25 with all submitters informed of results by May 2. 
2. Round 2: From April 15 to May 31 with all submitters informed of results by June 24.

The reason for creating two rounds is to provide early confirmation to those speakers who need a long time in advance to plan their travel (for example in order to request a visa).

On the other hand, we understand that many community members are currently collaborating on the development/launch of Airflow 3 and would find it difficult to submit before April, so that is why we are opening a 2nd CFP round on April-May.  

Speakers who submit to round 1 and are not selected, can still resubmit to round 2 and their submission(s) will be reviewed again and compared to other submissions in round 2 for selection.

### Topics and session duration

With the exception of lightning talks and workshops, sessions will either be 25 minutes or 45  minutes, and blocks will include time for Q&A. We will feature:

 * Airflow Intro - Basic or overview sessions target to new and potential Airflow users.
 * Airflow 3 - New features in Airflow 3, changes, tips for migrating and other considerations.
 * Roadmap - What is happening with Airflow further down the road and why.
 * Use Cases - Organizations share how they use Airflow 
 * Airflow & … - Airflow as a platform - building on top of Airflow (and/or combining with other tools) to make it more powerful
 * Community - How you can contribute to the overall health and strength of the community.
 * Workshops - any content relevant to Airflow  (2-3 hours)

### Code of Conduct

Apache Airflow Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled, at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated in any talk or activity related to the event. Exhibitors should also refrain from using sexualized images, activities, or other material. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact airflow-summit-organizers@googlegroups.com
